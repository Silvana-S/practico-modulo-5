```{r setup, knitr::opts_chunk$set, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

library(readxl)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tigris)
library(sf)
library(stringr)
library(viridis)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

pop_neighborhoods <- read_excel("data/PB_barrio_ARIP_CNP2010.xls", skip= 1, range = cell_cols(2:65))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
